## Overview

**Run & Route Hub** is a running-focused web app for UH students that helps runners:

- Find running partners based on pace and availability
- Access safe & UH-verified running routes
- Log runs and track progress
- View route difficulty scores (heat, slope, humidity, distance)
- Share safety feedback (lighting, crowds, sidewalks, water fountains)

This creates a **motivating and safety-focused running community** built specifically for UH students.
